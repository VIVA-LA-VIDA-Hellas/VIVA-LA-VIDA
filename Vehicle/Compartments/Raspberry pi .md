# For our microcontroller we chose: The Raspberry Pi 5

## Why we chose it

*Characteristics*
>The Raspberry Pi 5 is an overall compact but exceptionally speedy microcontroller, with large computational power and the >ability to run the full Linux operating system which is the default OS for RasPis.

*Compatability*
>We wanted to use python to programm our robot and since Linux is able to run OpenCV and our other needed libraries through programms such as Thonny or VScode, it was an easy option. 

*Requirements*
>The Raspberry Pi 5 can be powered with batteries, a factor which makes it highly suitable for projects that require a standalone power source for movement such as our car.

Additionally, It has a multitude of GPIO inputs for connectivity with a plethora of sensors and actuators, while the most crutial service it provides us with is the trusty I2C bus.
A compatability with I2C was a mandatory requirement for us as we wanted to eliminate the need of combining different microcontrollers and instead utilize the Raspberry Pi for our peripheral devices such as sensors and motors.
