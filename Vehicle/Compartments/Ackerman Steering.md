# Use of ackerman steering

### 1)The different curvature radii mean that to avoid sliding, the steering geometry must steer the inside front tire at a larger angle than the outside front. Ackermann Steering refers to the geometric configuration that allows both front wheels to be steered at the appropriate angle to avoid tire sliding.

### 2)For a given turn radius R, wheelbase L, and track width T, engineers calculate the required front steering angles (δ_(f, in) and (δ_(f, out)) with the following expressions:
