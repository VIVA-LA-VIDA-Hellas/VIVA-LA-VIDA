# Use of ackerman steering

## Defining Ackermann Steering
### Info from: [racecar-engineering.com](https://www.racecar-engineering.com) 

>### Consider a low-speed cornering manoeuvre, where all tyres are in pure rolling condition, and there is no vehicle sliding present. As the vehicle travels along a curved path, all four tyres follow unique trajectories around a shared turn centre, as defined by the blue arcs in Figure 1.

>### 1)The different curvature radii mean that to avoid sliding, the steering geometry must steer the inside front tire at a larger angle than the outside front. Ackermann Steering refers to the geometric configuration that allows both front wheels to be steered at the appropriate angle to avoid tire sliding.

>### 2)For a given turn radius R, wheelbase L, and track width T, engineers calculate the required front steering angles (δ_(f, in) and (δ_(f, out)) with the following expressions:

### 3) The difference in front-wheel steer angle as a function of the input steer angle is known as Dynamic Toe. If the vehicle dimensions are known, it is possible to construct a curve of the desired toe change for the full range of expected turn radii, such as the example in Figure 2.
