# Lithium Ion bateries (Li-ion)
## Why we chose them
Firstly, we compared the characteristics of Lithium, Lithium-Ion, Lipo and Alkaline batteries


### Lithium batteries
>Lithium batteries are one of the most commonly used battery types. They offer the highest energy density of any other battery cell, meaning they store more energy than other batteries, such as alkaline. Lithium batteries are only sold in AA, AAA, and 9V sizes; however, their mAh ratings exceed every other non-rechargeable battery. One AA lithium battery ranges from 2,700-3,400 mAh, and will last a long time, even under heavy-use.
<ins> Pros </ins>
Last up to 4x longer compared to other battery types
Light-weight for portable devices
Ideal for heavy-use
Function well even in extreme temperatures, working well in outdoor devices like flashlights
Shelf life is 10-12 years; great for use in emergency devices, as the batteries will not leak or explode
Cons
Much more expensive than other battery types
Highly flammable; require special disposal at specified locations and cannot be thrown away
Don’t come in bigger battery sizes like C or D

### Lithium-ion batteries 
> Lithium-ion batteries (Li-ion) are highly efficient, with a long cycle life, high energy and power density, and fast discharge capabilities, making them ideal for portable electronics. They can last up to 15 years, significantly longer than lead-acid batteries, reducing replacement costs. These batteries typically offer 500-7000 discharge cycles before needing replacement, depending on the chemistry used. The specific energy of Li-ion batteries ranges from 100–265 Wh/kg, with an energy density of 250–693 Wh/L. Characterizing the state of charge involves extensive experiments to evaluate parameters like voltage, current, temperature, capacity, and impedance. Li-ion batteries consist of four main components: cathode, anode, electrolyte, and separator, all essential for their function. Unlike lithium cells, Li-ion cells are rechargeable, with lifespans averaging 2-3 years or 300-500 charge cycles.
Key Points:
Lithium-ion batteries have high efficiencies, long cycle life, and high energy/power density.
They can last up to 15 years and offer 500-7000 discharge cycles.
Li-ion batteries consist of cathode, anode, electrolyte, and separator, all crucial for their operation.
Unlike lithium cells, Li-ion cells are rechargeable, lasting around 2-3 years or 300-500 charge cycles.

### Lipo batteries
>The advantages of Lipo batteries are small volume, huge capacity, light weight, non-pollution, high voltage of single cell, low self-discharging rate, more cycle times, but its price is comparatively high.
A Lipo battery is constructed from separate cells, all connected to form the specific battery. One Lipo cell has a nominal voltage of 3.7V. When connecting these in series, the voltage increases, meaning you get 7.4V for a 2 cell battery, 11.1V for a 3 cell battery, 14.8V for a 4 cell battery etc.
Enhanced Power Density: LiPo batteries offer a slightly higher power density, which means they can deliver a burst of power more quickly. This characteristic is valuable in scenarios where immediate, high-energy output is necessary.
How long does a 5,000mAh LiPo battery last? About 25–30 minutes on full discharge. Depending on what you are using it for. A batter such as this on a remote RC car being pushed at full throttle will last about 25 minutes.
Its chemistry leads to fire when the LiPo battery is punctured. Lithium polymer battery requires special care during charging, discharging, and storage. Li polymer battery is expensive. The cost is almost double that Li-Ion battery.
It is commonly accepted that the preferred way to dispose of a model LiPo pack is to immerse it in a container of salt water for an extended period 
The Li-Ion car battery is highly susceptible to too much heat. The overheating of the device or overcharging of the battery generally leads to more heat. The heat causes the cells of the battery to degrade faster than they usually do.

### Alkaline batteries
>Alkaline batteries are economical, easy to dispose of, and extremely popular. They normally have a capacity rating of over 2,500 mAh, great for moderate to heavy-use devices. Unlike lithium batteries, almost every standard size battery offers an alkaline construction, making it perfect for most devices.

Pros
Great price for quality
Last longer due to potassium hydroxide construction
Shelf life is 5-10 years
Function well even in extreme temperatures, working well in outdoor devices like flashlights
Lead, mercury, and cadmium-free is good for the environment, and the batteries don't need to be disposed of in a specific way
Cons
Heavy and bulky, without additional voltage
May not work well in high drain devices
Will sometimes leak, causing the device to become unusable
