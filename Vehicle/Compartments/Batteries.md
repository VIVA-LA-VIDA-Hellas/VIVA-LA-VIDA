Summary of Lithium-ion Batteries Advantages and Characteristics
> Lithium-ion batteries (Li-ion) are highly efficient, with a long cycle life, high energy and power density, and fast discharge capabilities, making them ideal for portable electronics. They can last up to 15 years, significantly longer than lead-acid batteries, reducing replacement costs. These batteries typically offer 500-7000 discharge cycles before needing replacement, depending on the chemistry used. The specific energy of Li-ion batteries ranges from 100–265 Wh/kg, with an energy density of 250–693 Wh/L. Characterizing the state of charge involves extensive experiments to evaluate parameters like voltage, current, temperature, capacity, and impedance. Li-ion batteries consist of four main components: cathode, anode, electrolyte, and separator, all essential for their function. Unlike lithium cells, Li-ion cells are rechargeable, with lifespans averaging 2-3 years or 300-500 charge cycles.
