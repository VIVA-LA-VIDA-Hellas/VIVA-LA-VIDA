# Lithium Ion bateries (Li-ion)
## Why we chose them
Firstly, we compared the characteristics of Lithium, Lithium-Ion, Lipo and Alkaline batteries
Lithium Batteries
>Lithium batteries are one of the most commonly used battery types. They offer the highest energy density of any other battery cell, meaning they store more energy than other batteries, such as alkaline. Lithium batteries are only sold in AA, AAA, and 9V sizes; however, their mAh ratings exceed every other non-rechargeable battery. One AA lithium battery ranges from 2,700-3,400 mAh, and will last a long time, even under heavy-use.
Pros
Last up to 4x longer compared to other battery types
Light-weight for portable devices
Ideal for heavy-use
Function well even in extreme temperatures, working well in outdoor devices like flashlights
Shelf life is 10-12 years; great for use in emergency devices, as the batteries will not leak or explode
Cons
Much more expensive than other battery types
Highly flammable; require special disposal at specified locations and cannot be thrown away
Don’t come in bigger battery sizes like C or D

Summary of Lithium-ion Batteries Advantages and Characteristics
> Lithium-ion batteries (Li-ion) are highly efficient, with a long cycle life, high energy and power density, and fast discharge capabilities, making them ideal for portable electronics. They can last up to 15 years, significantly longer than lead-acid batteries, reducing replacement costs. These batteries typically offer 500-7000 discharge cycles before needing replacement, depending on the chemistry used. The specific energy of Li-ion batteries ranges from 100–265 Wh/kg, with an energy density of 250–693 Wh/L. Characterizing the state of charge involves extensive experiments to evaluate parameters like voltage, current, temperature, capacity, and impedance. Li-ion batteries consist of four main components: cathode, anode, electrolyte, and separator, all essential for their function. Unlike lithium cells, Li-ion cells are rechargeable, with lifespans averaging 2-3 years or 300-500 charge cycles.
Key Points:
Lithium-ion batteries have high efficiencies, long cycle life, and high energy/power density.
They can last up to 15 years and offer 500-7000 discharge cycles.
Li-ion batteries consist of cathode, anode, electrolyte, and separator, all crucial for their operation.
Unlike lithium cells, Li-ion cells are rechargeable, lasting around 2-3 years or 300-500 charge cycles.
