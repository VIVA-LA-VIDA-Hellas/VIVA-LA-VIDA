7. Interface and Debugging
To make the robot easy to test and operate, we added some simple user-interface parts:
•	LEDs connected to GPIOs can show what the robot is doing: cruising, turning, avoiding an obstacle, which lap it is on, or basic sensor status.
•	Buttons let us start and stop runs directly on the robot, and there is an extra (“NOT USED”) button footprint for future features.
