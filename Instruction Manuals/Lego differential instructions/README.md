> Ensure you have all necessary parts before beginning construction

## Construct the Differential System

Assemble the differential system using the **motor base, DC motor, motor gear**, and several **LEGO parts**, along with **tie-ups** and **screw**s to secure everything in place.


Firstly take the motor base and the **lego technic liftarm (64179)** (photo1).
Insert the lego part through the hole shown in (photo2). 
The outcome should be similar to the one shown in (photo3).

Turn the structure upside down and add the **lego gear box** consisting of the 6 lego parts (1x 65414,1x 65413,4x 6589) (photo4)
Connect the the gear box to the motor base using the 2 axles: use the longer in the right side and the smaller one in the left
For extra steadiness use lego end stops (you can use the ones given to you) (photo5)

Take the two "biscuit" lego parts and grab yourself some **screws(3x12)**, a screw driver and a plier (photo6.1)
Tight the 3 screws as shown in the picture below (photo6.2)

Do the same thing in the other side, the outcome should be identical (or at least similar) to the one in the photo below

In this step, we actually need the [motor](https://grobotronics.com/metal-gearmotor-25mm-210rpm-9-12v.html) and some tire-ups
After you connect the the motor to the base as shown in (photo8).
For extra stability pass the tire-ups through the holes that are specifically made for them that are shown in pictures 8,9 (photo8),(photo9) and tighten them up.

![9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7e8be57-ea57-40fe-ba76-2715964a8e61)

Grab the 3d printed motor gear and attach it to the motor (photo10)

If you want to achieve the maximum reagarding the stability of the structure, get some extra screws and nuts and affix them to the construction as shown in the pictures below (photo11)

Have the steps been completed succesfully, the differnetial system is ready.
In order to link it with the rest of the chassis you need 6 screws (1 screw for each hole in the chassis)
Note: the holes of the two parts (motor base and chassis) should be allined. If not try relocating the screws
Consult the pitcure below for the connection of the two parts (photo12)
