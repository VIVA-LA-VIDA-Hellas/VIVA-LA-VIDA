INSTRUCTIONS - HOW TO ASSEMBLE THE MECHANICAL PARTS FROM SCRATCH!!!


It is quite remarkable to think that we can now construct a fully functional model car entirely from 3D-printed components
an intricate machine designed not merely for display, but to perform two carefully defined missions with precision and reliability.
What might first appear as a complex engineering task soon reveals itself to be an engaging and almost meditative process:
assembling each meticulously printed part, aligning the structure, and witnessing how digital design transforms into mechanical reality.
The beauty of 3D printing lies not only in its accuracy
but in its capacity to bring conceptual design into tangible form, translating digital blueprints into perfectly fitted mechanical elements.
As the car takes form, the experience becomes more than technical
it is a thoughtful exercise in creativity and focus, a fusion of innovation and craftsmanship that culminates in a model built with purpose, precision, and intent.


LET'S DO FIRST AN "HISTORICAL" REVIEW

  How were the 3D-printed parts designed?
  What tools are needed for the process? 
  How is the car assembled step by step?

THESE ARE SOME LOGICAL QUESTIONS THAT SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE

DESIGN OF 3D PARTS

All the 3D-printed components of the car were designed using Fusion 360, a powerful software that allowed precise modeling of every detail.

Throughout the development process, each part was refined repeatedly, with multiple design
iterations made to enhance efficiency, performance, and overall assembly compatibility.
This continuous cycle of testing and improvement ensured that every printed element met
the project’s functional requirements while maintaining structural accuracy and aesthetic quality.

Making changes to the original sketches was an essential part of achieving both efficiency and precision in the final design.
Each adjustment, whether in dimensions, geometry, or alignment, contributed to improving how the parts fit and functioned together.
These refinements not only reduced material waste and printing time but also ensured smoother assembly and more reliable performance during the car’s missions.
Through this iterative process, the design evolved from a basic concept into a well-optimized model capable of delivering consistent and accurate results.

After a series of careful modifications and refinements, the final model demonstrates an optimal balance between design accuracy and functional performance.
Each individual change, however small, contributed to a more efficient structure and smoother operation, ensuring that every component works seamlessly as part of the whole.
The result is a precisely engineered model car that fulfills its intended missions with reliability and efficiency, reflecting the success of a thoughtful and well-executed design process.

TOOLS AND EQUIPEMENT


Using 3D printers to produce the car’s components was a logical and efficient choice, given the need for precision, customization, and consistency across all parts.
Additive manufacturing allowed each piece to be fabricated directly from the digital design, ensuring exact dimensions and reducing the possibility of human error.
This method also made it possible to create complex geometries that would be difficult to achieve through traditional manufacturing,
while maintaining full control over material usage and production time.
The printers primarily used for this project were the Prusa i3 MK3S and the Prusa Mini, both known for their reliability, accuracy, and high-quality output.

To assemble the individual 3D-printed components, a combination of screws and nuts was used to ensure durable and stable connections between parts.
The assembly required the use of various hand tools, including precision screwdrivers, Allen keys, small wrenches, and pliers,
which allowed for accurate alignment and secure fastening without damaging the printed surfaces.
This method provided both strength and flexibility, enabling easy disassembly for maintenance or adjustments when needed.
Additionally, a few small modular elements (LEGO Components) were incorporated into certain sections,
adding an extra layer of versatility and precision to the overall construction.

In addition to the main 3D-printed and mechanical components, several secondary materials 
such as rubber bands and small springs were incorporated to enhance the car’s overall stability and efficiency.
These elements played a crucial role in absorbing vibrations, maintaining tension where needed, and ensuring smoother movement during operation.
Though simple in nature, these materials contributed significantly to the model’s performance,
providing flexibility and resilience that complemented the precision of the printed and assembled parts.
