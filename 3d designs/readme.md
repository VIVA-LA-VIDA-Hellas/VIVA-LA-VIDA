# INSTRUCTIONS - HOW TO ASSEMBLE THE 3D PRINTED MECHANICAL PARTS FROM SCRATCH

## OVERVIEW

  How were the 3D-printed parts designed?
  What tools are needed for the process? 
  How can the car be assembled step by step?


## DESIGN OF 3D PARTS

All the 3D-printed components of the car were designed using Fusion 360, a powerful software that allows us precise modeling of every detail.

Throughout the development process, each part was refined repeatedly, with multiple design
iterations made to enhance efficiency, performance, and overall assembly compatibility.
This continuous cycle of testing and improvement ensured that every printed element met
the project’s functional requirements while maintaining structural integrity.

In the following photo you can see an overview of the creation process of the motorbase throughout our versioning.

Making changes to the original sketches was an essential part of achieving both efficiency and precision in the final design.
Each adjustment, whether in dimensions, geometry, or alignment, contributed to improving how the parts fit and functioned together.
These refinements not only reduced material waste and printing time but also ensured smoother assembly and more reliable performance during the car’s missions.
Through this iterative process, the design evolved from a basic concept into a well-optimized model capable of delivering consistent and accurate results.

After a series of careful modifications and refinements, the final model demonstrates an optimal balance between design accuracy and functional performance.
Each individual change, however small, contributed to a more efficient structure and smoother operation, ensuring that every component works seamlessly as part of the whole.
The result is a precisely engineered model car that fulfills its intended missions with reliability and efficiency, reflecting the success of a thoughtful and well-executed design process.


## TOOLS AND EQUIPEMENT


Using 3D printers to produce the car’s components was a logical and efficient choice, given the need for precision, customization, and consistency across all parts.
It also helps us by eliminating the need for expensive replacements in the scenario of a broken part, since we can easily print a replica at a fraction of the cost.
Additive manufacturing allowed each piece to be fabricated directly from the digital design, ensuring exact dimensions and reducing the possibility of human error.
This method also made it possible to create complex geometries that would be difficult to achieve through traditional manufacturing, while maintaining full control over material usage and production time.

> [!NOTE]
> The printers primarily used for this project were the Prusa i3 MK3S and the Prusa Mini, both known for their reliability, accuracy, and high-quality output.

To assemble the individual 3D-printed components, a combination of **screws** and **nuts** was used to ensure durable and stable connections between parts.
The assembly required the use of various hand tools, including
>
> Precision screwdrivers
>
> Allen keys
>
> Small wrenches
>
> Pliers
>
> Rulers, Measuring tapes and other measuring tools


which allowed for accurate alignment and secure fastening without damaging the printed surfaces.
This method provided both strength and flexibility, enabling easy disassembly for maintenance or adjustments when needed.
Additionally, a few small modular elements (LEGO Components) were incorporated into certain sections,
adding an extra layer of versatility and precision to the overall construction.

In addition to the main 3D-printed and mechanical components, several secondary materials 
such as **rubber bands** and **small springs** were incorporated to enhance the car’s overall stability and efficiency.
These elements played a crucial role in absorbing vibrations, maintaining tension where needed, and ensuring smoother movement during operation.
Though simple in nature, these materials contributed significantly to the model’s performance,
providing flexibility and resilience that complemented the precision of the printed and assembled parts.

## Step 1: Prepare Your 3D Printing Software

Download PrusaSlicer or another 3D printer software of your choice, then upload each model file individually.


Before assembly begins, you’ll need to prepare your parts for printing
PrusaSlicer is a reliable and easy-to-use program that allows you to view, adjust, and slice your 3D files for printing.
Simply open the software, import each part file one at a time, and make sure all components are correctly oriented and ready for your specific printer setup.
Once uploaded, you can check print settings such as scale, infill, and support structures if necessary.
This step ensures that all your car parts will print accurately and fit together perfectly during assembly.

Step 2: Locate and Prepare the Model Files for Printing

Open the provided folder and upload each part file into your slicer software. Some parts need to be printed multiple times.


You will recieve a folder containing the 3d files for the car.
Inside the folder you received, you’ll find all the 3D model files required to build your car.
Each file has been carefully designed and tested for compatibility, so you won’t need to make any modifications.
Simply open your slicer program (such as PrusaSlicer) and load the files one by one.
Make sure to print the correct quantities for each component as listed below:

1× Chassis
1× Camera Base
1× Servo Base
3× Distance Sensor Bases
1× Motor Gear
3× Time of Flight (ToF) Sensor Bases

Double-check that all parts are correctly oriented and fit within your printer’s build volume.
Once everything looks ready, you can proceed to slicing and printing each part according to your printer’s material and settings.





Step 3: Construct the Differential System

Assemble the differential system using the motor base, DC motor, motor gear, and several LEGO parts, along with tie-ups and screws to secure everything in place.
