# Updates:

Re stabilised the camera holder with optimal screws
Tried to run the robot on the track ran into weight issues
Fixed errors and experimented on the above with the help of our teacher
Worked on 3d printing an entirely new camera base since it was still slightly wonky 
Large revamp of github repository, added more photos, new organisation folders
and missing information/reorganisation of existing folders
