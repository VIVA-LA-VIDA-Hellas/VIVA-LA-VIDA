# Updates:

We finished the cable management on the new robot we created during the previous meeting and booted it up for trials - so far it is working as expected without the movement of pieces.
The oled screen we have on the placket shows 
> - CPU load
> - Memory usage
> - Disc usage
Additionally, we ran some more tests on the previous model of the robot and continued trying to fix the issue with the sensor I2C addresses coliding but to no avail yet.
Nevertheless it behaved better than previously on the track up to the moment it collided with the wall.
