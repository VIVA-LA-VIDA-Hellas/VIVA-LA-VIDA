# Updates:

The colour sensor was reattatched to the main body after some edits made during the previous session due to faulty wire connections, as well as coming to a total of three ultrasonic distance sensors to cover both left and right sides and front for later versions.
We used Only the left sensor to start with and created a pid program to stay within 20cm distance of the inner wall
