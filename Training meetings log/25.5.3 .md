# Updates:

We printed connecting pieces to stabilise the portion of lego we borrowed (ackerman) with the wheels of our robot,
The first print was too small on the wheels side (robot) while being too large for the axle side (lego)
The second was satisfactory on the robots side but not so much on the axle side (too loose this time)
Third print was near acceptable but we decided to print it a fourth time for safe measure.
On the programming/hardwiring of the robot, we had difficulty restarting the system every time for tests so we added a physical button to stop the program. Also fixed some connection issues with the placket we made for cable management previously.
