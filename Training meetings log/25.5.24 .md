# Updates:

Todays session was heavily based on coding the first mission and debugging used up most of our time since we carefully skimmed through any errors in order to ensure that it would run smoothly
Trials were done on the previous lego version of the robot, although it utilized an older version raspberry pi and will be changed in the future to run faster.
Additionally, we continued creating the new lego base from yesterday with more edits on the never ending 3d base versions...
