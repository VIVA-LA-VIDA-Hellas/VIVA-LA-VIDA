# Recap July - October 

### After the summer holidays ended, we had a plethora undocumented meetings, during which we managed to replace most of the car compartments from the previous versions with our own original 3d printed compartments.
### The compartments we 3d printed are listen bellow

> Base for differential and motor
> 
> Chasis
>
> Base for TOF (time of flight) sensors
>
> Ultrasonic sensor (updated)
>
> Camera base (updated)
>
> Servo base

### Additionally, we changed our servo to a model that can withstand more force, due to the previous ones often breaking

> Old servo -> SG90
> 
> New servo -> MG996

### We also changed our motor to a more powerfull one, editing the bases to match the new and improved version.

> Old motor ->
>
> New motor ->

### On the programming side there were many updates to the previously working code for the first mission, mostly changes due to different libraries being used for the new servo. Specifically, we replaced the previous adafruit servokit and motorkit libraries for the adafruit pca9685, combining the movement of the two.
