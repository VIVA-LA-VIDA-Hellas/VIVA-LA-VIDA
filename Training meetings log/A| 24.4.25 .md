# Updates:

Worked on improving errors during turn recognition on the middle lane canny program, specifically seeing turns as gaps instead of continuous track. Furthermore we used spare parts to enhance the build (screws to stabilize camera and raspberry pi).
We then started to deconstruct a lego vehicle to use part of it as a prototype differential for the back wheels of the car.
Started testing the robot movement by combining the servo movement programs with the middle lane canny program 
in order to follow the path created by it.
Discovered new errors due to the low height of the camera and the movement of wires to fix during the next meeting...
