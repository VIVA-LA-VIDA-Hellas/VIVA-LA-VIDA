# Updates:

Firstly, we ensured that our distance sensors weren't pointed at an angle since it accumulated to a misstarget of the walls and the feedback that was returned to us from them was much larger than the actual distance between the sensors and the walls.
Second, we created a lego base to raise the front distance sensor higher as to also improve its accuracy.
We used zip ties to secure the lego in place, connecting them directly through the pieces.
