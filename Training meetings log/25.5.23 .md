# Updates:

### 3D printing
The 3d printing of the base finalized and was good to go after adding some small lego bits for stabilisation (so tha it wouldn't bend and inevitably snap). 
We reprinted the gear so that it was a perfect fit for the motor (It literally doesn't budge one bit when trying to remove it)

### Lego robot v2
Issues with previous lego robot
>  - Not enough space for the 3d base-lego differential, would need major shifts to incorporate them
>
>  - The placket we used lost signal from time to time
>
>  - There was no room for the camera


For all the above reasons plus our desire to always have a backup, we decided to keep that version as is and create another lego robot mirroring parts of the previous one while using the hardware components of our original -non lego- robot (raspberry pi, sensors, placket, batteries etc)
