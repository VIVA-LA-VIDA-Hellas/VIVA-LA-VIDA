# Updates:

new robot (lego base)
changed placket
changed colour sensor TCS34725
algorythm for all sensors

We once again changed the cable managment placket to ensure no short circuit/discontinuity would happen since we added additional wires.
We changed the colour sensor we where using from LSM6DS3 to TCS34725 to ensure faster more reliable results
