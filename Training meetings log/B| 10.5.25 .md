# Updates:

We once again changed the cable managment placket to a slightly larger one as to ensure no short circuit/discontinuity would happen since we added additional wires overwhelming the previous one.
We changed the colour sensor we where using from LSM6DS3 to TCS34725 to ensure faster more reliable results (as proven from our tests with the new sensor)
In the prosess of trying out the new colour sensor we also improved the general sensor algorythm including the two distance sensors and ran into an issue where the I2C adress of the combined distanse sensors and colour sensor coincided and would stop working when the address was altered.

Finally and most importantly, we started creating a new robot based on the needs of the previous one using a lego base combined with the hardware used previously (LION 18650 batteries with base and voltage regulator, raspberry pi 4/5 etc) while also soldering on 5 leds ( 3 smaller ones for general trials and two larger red/green ones for the second mission). Finally we 3d printed a piece to securely attach the motor to the legos and only the cable connections & managment remains. This process was fairly easy since we already have a good knowledge (after much trial and error) of the key components we are most likely going to use and therefore only needed to replicate the previous build and connections onto a different scale.
