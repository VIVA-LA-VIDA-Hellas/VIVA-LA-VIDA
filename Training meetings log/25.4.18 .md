# Updates:

Renewed and updated system on raspberry pi, including downloading missing libraries and testing
different enviroments such as vscode.
3d printed a base for the servo motor.
Connected several cameras to pi in an attempt to run the camera programs which previously didn't 
run outside of terminal, found solution by using a combination of opencv and picamera library.
Tested and aproved changes with multiple cameras and recieved satisfactory feed.
