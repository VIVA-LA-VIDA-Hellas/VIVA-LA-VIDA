# Updates:

We had a shorter meeting, therefore we spent the majority of our time focusing on finding a way to connect our 3d printed motor base with lego so that it can be readily connected to our second robot.
Additionally, we connected to it the lego differential (as mentioned before borrowed and edited from the lego G-Wagon set)
Since the motor has to connect to the lego gears on the differential, we also 3d printed a gear to serve that purpose, although the inner circle radius (cutout) was slightly larger than we wanted it.
On the topic of 3d printing, while connecting the base with the lego differential, we realised the weight of the motor caused the base to bend and make contact with the lego therefore rendering it almost unable to turn, so we started a new print with a small cutout in the specific area that was creating the issue.
