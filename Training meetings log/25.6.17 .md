# Updates:

We updated a placket to use on the raspbery pi4 so we can commence trials once more for the first mission. The camera detection worked well, but since we had to factory reset the device previously due to errors, we needed to redownload all libraries, of which the circuit python lib did not wish to cooperate.
We took some measurements for a new base for our distance sensor and also some colour measurments in an attempt to detect the direction of the robot (clockwise or anti clockwise) using only the camera.
Additionally, we added an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) to detect the correct moment for turns, which measured extremely precisely and will move to the next versions of our robot.
