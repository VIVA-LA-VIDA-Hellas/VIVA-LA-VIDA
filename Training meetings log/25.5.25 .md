# Updates:

Today we worked with the original version of the robot since the lego one was in the process of charging and the newest one is still being created.
Another wire on the placket got loose and inevitably cut at a certain point so we had to once again edit that arrangement.
We added an MPU and also re stabilized the distance and colour sensors which where starting to seperate form the build. 
Some edits where also done to a program we made to follow the inner wall of the track as to follow it closer and for 11 turn-forward movement repetitions not including the first turn, therefore simulating the first mission requirements of three laps.
