# Updates:

Finalized the 3d printed motor base, photos include all 4 versions side by side comparison.
Tested it out on the robot and made adjustments.
Finished the deconstruction of the lego car, isolating the necessary compartments of the differential.
Improved the code for turn recognition specifically, by connecting the gap between the two paths as smoothly as possible.
Used the improved program and started the construction of a newer version with an added a red line to indicate the average of the path the robot needs to follow.
in order to have a reference point that the robot tries to center (thus controling the steering to keep it in the correct position).
Fixed the error where wires moving stopped the flow of the program by soldering with a prototype board that goes directly on the raspberry.
