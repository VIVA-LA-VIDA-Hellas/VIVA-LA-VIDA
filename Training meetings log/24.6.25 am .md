# Updates:

Since the robot started effectively looping around the track, the next step is to include the ability to detect if it is going clockwise or anti-clockwise. 
To do that we experimented both with the colour sensor, building a new base for it to screw under our robot and untill its correct callibration we also made a backup where it uses the side distance sensors to detect the first big gap, indicating the turn direction. 
Additionaly, we sketched out an aproximation of what each of the three sensor views during an anti-clockwise turning run.
