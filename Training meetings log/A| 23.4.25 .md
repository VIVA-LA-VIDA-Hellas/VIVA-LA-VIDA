# Updates:

Tested out the combination of the middle_lane_canny with the movement of the
servo motors in an attempt to begin trials for the first challenge. 
We all Tested the robot on the track, experimenting with different cameras as well as using diy 
solutions to fix conectivityissues such as taping down wires and using extra screws to stabilise
the camera even further.
Also further improved the 3d print design of the servo motor base.
