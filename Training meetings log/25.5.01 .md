# Updates:
Today we had a lighter day due to it being a national holiday.
We completed the 3d printing of the camera base that was designed previously, but the screw holes for the camera
needed a bit more distance so we got to work and redisigned it to fix the issue.
Additionally, the wire connecting the fisheye camera to the microbit 4 was too short for the new camera base
design, so we switched the raspberry 4 to the raspberry 5 (which we had a longer wire).
