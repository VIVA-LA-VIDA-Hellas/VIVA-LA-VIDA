# Recap July - October 

After the summer holidays ended, we had a plethora undocumented meetings, during which we managed to replace most of the car compartments from the previous versions with our own original 3d printed compartments.
The compartments we 3d printed are listen bellow

> Base for differential and motor
> Chasis
> Base for TOF (time of flight) sensors
> Ultrasonic sensor (updated)
> Camera base (updated)
> Servo base

Additionally, we changed our servo to a model that can withstand more force, due to the previous ones often breaking
> Old servo -> SG90
> New servo -> MG996
