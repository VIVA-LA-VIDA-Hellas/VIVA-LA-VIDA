# Updates:

Today we spent our time deciding on further steps.
We chose to build moreso on the first version of the robot compared to the lego ones due to time pressure, so we made an effort to rearrange the compartments of the robot in order to better suit our needs (eg the 3d printed motor base didnt fit when combined with the lego differential)
We made a placket but didn't end up using it since it didn't end up meeting our needs.
Additionally more changes where made to the design of the holders for the colour sensors.
