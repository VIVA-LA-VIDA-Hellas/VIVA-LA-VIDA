# Updates:

Our session was spent editing the code for the first mission, specifically we made an attempt to use the camera to detect the order of the orange/blue lines at the start, using that as an indication of the direction it is to follow.
Additionally, we combined that detection -which was made using the base of the red-green detection we made a while ago- with the main program. (middle lane detection combined with distance sensor to see the front distance from the walls, indicating a turn)
