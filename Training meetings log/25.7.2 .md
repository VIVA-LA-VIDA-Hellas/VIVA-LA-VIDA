# Updates:

We finished the design of a 3d printed base for the HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor.
Half of the the chassis has already been printed and will be modified in order to match the PCB design.
Additionally, we completed designing the schematic for the PCB and moved onto its materialization.
We payed special attention to the connections between each module/component needed to function.
