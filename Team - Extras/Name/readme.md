# **V I V A  Λ Α  V Ι Δ Α**

## Our name is essentially a word play on the famously known phrase *Viva La Vida*
> ### Meaning to "Live life"
## In greek, "Vida (Βίδα)" Literally means "a screw", completely changing the meaning of the phrase to us
> ### Now, it means "Long live the screw"

## We found this coincidence quite fitting, and when we changed up the letters to use both the Latin and Greek alphabets, we managed to create a name that -when capitalized- managed to use only straight lines and formed some very satisfying geometrical shapes.
