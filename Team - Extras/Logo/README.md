# Logo versioning 

### Our first logo was designed using Canva back in 2024
<div style="width: 60%; height: 60%">

</div>


### When we began creating our team shirts and searching for sponsors, we decided it was time for an upgrade to a more wearable, minimalistic design that would still encapsulate our teams name "VIVA ΛΑ VIΔΑ", with emphasis on the combination of the greek and english alphabet aswell as the wordplay on VΙΔΑ (Vida), which in greek -literally means- screw.

### Here are some of the first rough sketches

### We ended up liking the last photo the most, and after discussion thought it would be cool to combine it with the innitials of our team name (VΛV), therefore giving birth to the next idea:

### This also combined a pleasing visual of our team as it consists of two boys and one girl, represented by the letters (Where the screw acts as a head for each member)
